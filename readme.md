# **Tickless Timer (ttim) - Example on EDUCIAA**

This example uses [ttim](https://gitlab.com/fbucafusco/ttim) library to implement a 4 LED blinker on the EDUCCIA using the framework [firmware_v3](https://github.com/epernia/firmware_v3).

The bsp uses sapi library to configure the timers (included in the framework). 

ttim provides the hability to implement asynchronous timers without the need to tick periodically.
